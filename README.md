# Using Full Flash Update (FFU) files to speed up Windows deployment
This repo contains the full FFU process that we use in US Education at Microsoft to help customers with large deployments of Windows as they prepare for the new school year. 

If you're not familiar with Github, you can click the Green code button above and select download zip. Everything will be in the FFU-main.zip file. Extract that file and go to the FFUDevelopment\Docs\BuildDeployFFU.docx file to get started
