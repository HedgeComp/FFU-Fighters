# Using Full Flash Update (FFU) files to speed up Windows deployment
This repo contains the full FFU process that we use in US Education at Microsoft to help customers with large deployments of Windows as they prepare for the new school year. 

If you're not familiar with Github, you can click the Green code button above and select download zip. Extract the zip file and make sure to copy the FFUDevelopment to the root of your C: drive. You should have a folder on c:\FFUDevelopment. That will make it easy to follow the guide and allow the scripts to work properly. 

If extracted correctly, your c:\FFUDevelopment folder should look like the following. If it does, go to c:\FFUDevelopment\Docs\BuildDeployFFU.docx to get started.
